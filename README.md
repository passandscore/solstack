<summary>Quickstart Commands</summary>

Run this command to install dependencies, compile contracts, and execute all tests:

```bash
make
```

## Setting Up Environment Variables


Create a .env file in the project directory.


In the .env file, provide the following environment variable by replacing <url> with your  RPC URL. For example:


```bash
<RPC_URL>=<url>
```


Running the Test Suite
Now that you've set up your environment variables, follow these steps to run the test suite:
In the terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
 source .env
 forge test --fork-url $<RPC_URL>
 ```

## Running a Single Test Suite

To run specific test suites, use:

```bash
forge test --match-path "test/Soulbound.t.sol" --fork-url $<RPC_URL>
or
forge test --match-path "test/upgradable/ShardsRWA/*.t.sol" --fork-url $<RPC_URL>
```

## Coverage

To generate coverage reports, first install genhtml:

```bash
brew install genhtml
```

> Note: If you encounter the error No available formula with the name "genhtml". Did you mean ekhtml?, run the following command:

```bash
brew install lcov
```

Finally, generate the coverage report with:

```bash
yarn run coverage
```
